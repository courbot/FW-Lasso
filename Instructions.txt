% FW-LASSO: INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE %
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


This readme file provides basic instructions to use the code as done in the paper

Frandi E., Nanculef R., Lodi S., Sartori C., Suykens J.A.K., "Fast and Scalable Lasso via Stochastic Frank-Wolfe Methods with a Convergence Guarantee", Internal Report 15-93, ESAT-STADIUS, KU Leuven, 2015. 


INSTALLING THE PACKAGE 

clone or download the GitHub repository and run the “make all” command in the “FW-Lasso” directory from the command line. Requires a working C/C++ compiler (e.g. gcc).


RUNNING THE ALGORITHM

The basic working example of how to build a regularization path (100 parameter values) for a Lasso problem 

min 0.5*||X*alpha - y||^2 s.t. ||alpha||_1 <= delta

is provided below:

./lasso-train -E 1 -FM 10000 -RS 1 -SC 1 -e 0.001 -RM <delta_max/100> -RX <delta_max> -a <sampling_size> -BW 1 -AH 1 <dataset_path>/<dataset_name.txt>

Input: 

- delta_max is the maximum value of the constraint/regularization parameter

- sampling_size should be an integer (e.g. -a 5000 samples 5000 features at each iteration)

Output:

- a SUMMARY file with various statistics for the current run

- a RESULTS file with the solutions (in sparse format) for each value of the parameter along the path: 1st column -> current value of delta; 2nd column -> # of active features; 3rd column -> l1-norm of solution (un-normalized); 4th column -> l1-norm of solution (normalized); 5th column -> objective value; 0:<val_0> -> intercept value; 1:<val_1> … p:<val_p> -> coefficients for features 1 … p. 


NOTES

- Running the command “lasso-train” without any input gives a more detailed overview of the available options.

- The dataset files have to be stored in the LIBSVM sparse format (see http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvm/):

<label/response> <index1>:<value1> <index2>:<value2> ... <indexN>:<valueN>

This design choice is motivated by the fact that the code is tailored to solve large-scale problems.
